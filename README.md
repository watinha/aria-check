Introduction
============
Aria-check is a Firefox Addon that helps web developers implement ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/). It runs a suite of tests in your web application searching for ARIA implementations and asserts wether the behavior of the widgets you have in your application matches the WAI-ARIA specification.

There are still a couple of things related to project setup... so this is a clear working in progress project
